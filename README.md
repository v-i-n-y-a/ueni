# UENI Front-end Interview Test

Task: Build a basic web application with ReactJS based on the assets in the zip file provided.

Files:
 - step_1.png
 - step_2.png
 - reviews-data.json
 - businesses-data.json

## Application
The application has only two pages, step-1 and step-2. Step-1 lists the data from businesses-data in a grid like fashion, whist the step-2 represents the summary page of the selected business.

### Requirements

#### Step-1
 - List all business data in businesses-data.json by default (not sorted or filtered)
 - Show the business image, description, location and name 
 - Have functionality to sort the business in alphabetical order
 - Have functionality to filter by category
 - Click on the business forwards the user to step-2 with details of the business clicked on

#### Step-2
 - Show the business image, description, location, name and calculated reviews score. 
 - If no reviews data available, show a message "No reviews"

#### Design
The images of the steps provided are wireframes of the pages. Base the layout of the page from them, but you can use preferred styling tools. Adapt the wireframes for range of devices.

#### Data
businesses-data.json has all the needed data for step-1. For step-2 you will need to combine the data from reviews-data.json. The field names are self-explanatory.
